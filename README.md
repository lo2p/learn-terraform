# Learn‑Terraform: A Hands‑On Learning

> A self-guided roadmap to mastering Terraform through progressive lessons and real-world infrastructure builds.

# Terraform

Terraform is an **infrastructure-as-code (IaC)** tool by HashiCorp that lets you define, provision, and manage infrastructure across cloud and on-prem environments using human-readable, versionable configuration files.

Key strengths include:

- **Multi‑Cloud Capability**: Seamlessly manage resources across providers like AWS, GCP, Azure, and more.
- **Declarative Workflow**: Write the desired end-state; Terraform handles the provisioning logic, building a resource graph for accurate dependency resolution
- **Modules & Reusability**: Structure configurations into reusable modules to drive consistency and maintainability—core to scaling IaC.
- **State Management**: Keeps a state file as the source-of-truth for infrastructure, letting Terraform identify and apply only necessary changes.
